#+title: rogo client test suite

# This file is created with org-mode, an awesome outliner and
# personal information manager for emacs. In org-mode, this file
# will appear as a foldable outline, but if you don't want to use
# emacs, it's fine to just edit it by hand.

* DONE [1/2] basic i/o
** DONE establish a command loop and a way to exit

#+name: io.q
#+begin_src
> q
= q : quit
: The 'q' command instructs rogo-shell to quit.
:
: the shell should not produce any output unless
: explicitly instructed to do so.
#+end_src

** TODO list available challenges/courses

* NOTE How to add a new test.

- Think of a situation that needs to be tested.
- Think of the commands you would need to issue to make that situation happen.
- Write a new test that shows the expected behavior.

Here is the test format (remove the leading ':  ' from each line, and also the comments on the right).

:  #+name: test.name                    <- must be unique!
:  #+begin_src                          <- marks start of test
:  # other lines with # are comments    <- comment
:  > o                                  <- '>' indicates an input line
:  output                               <- anything besides (#, >, :, or =)
:  more output                           | is expected output.
:  > q                                  <- always send the quit command!
:  = my very own test                   <- this is the title for the test
:  : This is where I describe the test. <- ':' indicates a line of description
:  : Here's another descriptive line.    | these lines show up when a test fails.
:  #+end_src                            <- marks end of test
